# Contrast MCP Server

⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING: EXPOSING YOUR CONTRAST VULNERABILITY DATA TO A LLM THAT TRAINS ON YOUR DATA CAN POTENTIALLY EXPOSE YOUR VULNERABILITY DATA TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. Thus, do not use mcp-contrast functions which pull sensitive data with a LLM that trains on your data.  

Verify AI Data Privacy: Before sending vulnerability data to an AI, you must confirm that your service agreement guarantees your data will not be used for model training.

UNSAFE: Public consumer websites (e.g., the free versions of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude). These services often use your input for training.

POTENTIALLY-SAFE: Enterprise-grade services (e.g. Google Cloud AI, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI) or paid plans that contractually ensure data privacy and prevent model training on your prompts, verify with your information security teams.

## Data Privacy
The Contrast MCP Server provides a bridge between your Contrast Data and the AI Agent/LLM of your choice.
By using Contrast's MCP server you will be providing your Contrast Data to your AI Agent/LLM, it is your responsibility to ensure that the AI Agent/LLM you use complies with your data privacy policy.
Depending on what questions you ask the following information will be provided to your AI Agent/LLM.
* Application Details
* Application Rule configuration
* Vulnerability Details
* Route Coverage data
* ADR/Protect Attack Event Details

## Build
Requires Java 17+

`mvn clean install`

## Run
To add the MCP Server to your local AI system, modify the config.json file and add the following

```json
"mcpServers": {
    "contrast-mcp": {
      "command": "/usr/bin/java", "args": ["-jar","/Users/name/workspace/mcp-contrast/mcp-contrast/target/mcp-contrast-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar",
        "--CONTRAST_HOST_NAME=example.contrastsecurity.com",
        "--CONTRAST_API_KEY=xxx",
        "--CONTRAST_SERVICE_KEY=xxx",
        "--CONTRAST_USERNAME=xxx.xxx@contrastsecurity.com",
        "--CONTRAST_ORG_ID=xxx"]
    }
}
```

You obviously need to configure the above to match your contrast API Creds.

## Docker

### Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t mcp-contrast .
```


### Using Copilot + Petclinic
Download the Vulnerable Pet Clinic.
`git clone https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/vulnerable-spring-petclinic.git`
Open the project in VSCode or Intellij.
Edit the contrast_security.yaml file and configure it with your AGENT credentials
```yaml
api:
  url: https://xxx/Contrast
  api_key: xxx
  service_key: xxx
  user_name: xxx
# All other contrast config is done in the docker-compose file. Do not check this file in to git!
```
Then you can build and run using docker-compose
`docker compose up --build`
It will build and run the services that make up petclinic.
To build out the vulnerabilites and attack events run
`./testscript.sh`
Select option 25. ( this will exercise the app and perform attacks to populate the vulnerabilities and attack events)
#### Install via Link in VScode

Claude Desktop is a desktop application that allows you to use the Claude AI model locally. It can be configured to use the Contrast MCP server for enhanced functionality.
To setup Claude Desktop with the Contrast MCP server, follow these steps:
In Claude Desktop, go to the settings and then the Developer tab.
![claude1.png](images/claude1.png)
Then select Edit Config and edit the `claude_desktop_config.json` file.
Add the following configuration to the `claude_desktop_config.json` file:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "contrastmcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-e",
        "CONTRAST_HOST_NAME",
        "-e",
        "CONTRAST_API_KEY",
        "-e",
        "CONTRAST_SERVICE_KEY",
        "-e",
        "CONTRAST_USERNAME",
        "-e",
        "CONTRAST_ORG_ID",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "contrast/mcp-contrast:latest",
        "-t",
        "stdio"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CONTRAST_HOST_NAME": "example.contrastsecurity.com",
        "CONTRAST_API_KEY": "xxx",
        "CONTRAST_SERVICE_KEY": "xxx",
        "CONTRAST_USERNAME": "xxx.xxx@example.com",
        "CONTRAST_ORG_ID": "xxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Once you have added the configuration you will need to restart the Claude Desktop application for the change to take effect.
After you have restarted the application, you should be able to use Claude Desktop to interact with the Contrast MCP server. For example :

## Proxy Configuration

### Java Process
If you need to configure a proxy for your Java process when using the standalone JAR, you can set the Java system properties for HTTP and HTTPS proxies:

```bash
java -Dhttp_proxy_host=proxy.example.com -Dhttp_proxy_port=8080 -jar /path/to/mcp-contrast-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --CONTRAST_HOST_NAME=example.contrastsecurity.com --CONTRAST_API_KEY=example --CONTRAST_SERVICE_KEY=example --CONTRAST_USERNAME=example@example.com --CONTRAST_ORG_ID=example
```

When configuring in your config.json file, include the proxy settings in the args array:

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "contrast-assess": {
    "command": "/usr/bin/java", 
    "args": [
      "-Dhttp_proxy_host=proxy.example.com", 
      "-Dhttp_proxy_port=8080",
      "-jar",
      "/Users/name/workspace/mcp-contrast/mcp-contrast/target/mcp-contrast-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar",
      "--CONTRAST_HOST_NAME=example.contrastsecurity.com",
      "--CONTRAST_API_KEY=example",
      "--CONTRAST_SERVICE_KEY=example",
      "--CONTRAST_USERNAME=example@example.com",
      "--CONTRAST_ORG_ID=example"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Docker
When running the MCP server in Docker, you can configure the proxy by passing the relevant environment variables:


```bash
docker run \
  -e http_proxy_host="proxy.example.com" \
  -e http_proxy_port="8080" \
  -e CONTRAST_HOST_NAME=example.contrastsecurity.com \
  -e CONTRAST_API_KEY=example \
  -e CONTRAST_SERVICE_KEY=example \
  -e CONTRAST_USERNAME=example \
  -e CONTRAST_ORG_ID=example \
  -i \
  contrast/mcp-contrast:latest \
  -t stdio

```

For VS Code configuration with Docker and proxy, modify the settings.json like this:

```json
"mcp": {
  "inputs": [],
  "servers": {
    "contrast-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
        "args": [
        "run",
        "-e",
        "CONTRAST_HOST_NAME",
        "-e",
        "CONTRAST_API_KEY",
        "-e",
        "CONTRAST_SERVICE_KEY",
        "-e",
        "CONTRAST_USERNAME",
        "-e",
        "CONTRAST_ORG_ID",
        "-e", "http_proxy_host",
        "-e", "http_proxy_port",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "contrast/mcp-contrast:latest",
        "-t",
        "stdio"
        ],
        "env": {
            "CONTRAST_HOST_NAME": "example.contrastsecurity.com",
            "CONTRAST_API_KEY": "example",
            "CONTRAST_SERVICE_KEY": "example",
            "CONTRAST_USERNAME": "example@example.com",
            "CONTRAST_ORG_ID": "example",
            "http_proxy_host": "proxy.example.com",
            "http_proxy_port": "8080"
        }
    }
  }
}
```

## Common Issues
If you are experiencing issues with the MCP server, here are some common troubleshooting steps:
### Review Log
A log will be created, by default under `/tmp/mcp-contrast.log` either locally or witin the docker container. You can view this log to see if there are any errors or issues with the MCP server.

### Enable Debug Logging
To enable debug logging you can add the following flag to the command line arguments when running the MCP server:
`--logging.level.root=DEBUG`
This can be added at this part of the docker command 
```
        "--rm",
        "contrast/mcp-contrast:latest",
        "-t",
         "--logging.level.root=DEBUG",
        "stdio"
        ],
```

### Certificate Issues
If the SSL Certificate for the Teamserver URL is not trusted, you may see the following error:
```
Failed to list applications: PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```
If this occurs you will need to add the certificate to the Java Truststore and then add the following to the command line arguments when running the MCP server:
`-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/loctaion/to/mcp-truststore.jks, -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=yourpassword`
More details on how to do this can be found in the [Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19509-01/820-3503/6nf1il6er/index.html). Or ask your LLM to help you with this.
