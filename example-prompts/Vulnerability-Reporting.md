# Vulnerability Report Generation Prompt for Contrast MCP

## Objective
Generate a comprehensive, role-based security vulnerability report with interactive HTML interface that provides tailored views for different stakeholders (Developer, Manager, CISO, Business Person).

## Instructions

Please create an interactive HTML vulnerability report with the following specifications:

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Use `mcp_contrastmcp_list_all_applications` to find available applications
- Select the most relevant application for analysis (or ask user to specify)
- Use `mcp_contrastmcp_list_vulnerabilities` to get all vulnerabilities for the chosen application
- Use `mcp_contrastmcp_get_vulnerability` to get detailed information for Critical and High severity issues
- Use `mcp_contrastmcp_get_ADR_Protect_Rules` to understand available protection capabilities

### 2. **Report Structure**
Create an HTML file with these four distinct role-based views:

#### **üë®‚Äçüíª Developer View**
- Technical vulnerability details with exact code locations
- Stack traces and vulnerable code examples
- Specific remediation code examples (vulnerable vs. secure)
- Time estimates for fixes
- Priority rankings for development planning

#### **üìä Manager View** 
- Visual dashboards with Chart.js charts showing:
  - Vulnerability severity distribution (pie/doughnut chart)
  - Fix time estimates (bar chart)
  - Risk reduction over time (line chart)
  - Security posture radar chart
- Project metrics (team size, sprint allocation, technical debt)
- Two-phase approach (immediate ADR protection + code fixes)

#### **üîí CISO View**
- Enterprise risk assessment with CVSS scores
- Compliance impact analysis (PCI DSS, GDPR, etc.)
- Financial risk projections
- Current ADR rule status and recommendations
- Board-level executive summary
- Threat landscape and attack vector visualizations

#### **üíº Business Person View**
- Simple, non-technical explanations using analogies
- Timeline of potential attack scenarios
- Financial impact breakdown (direct and indirect costs)
- Probability assessments in plain language
- Cost-benefit analysis comparing protection options
- Emphasis on Contrast ADR as immediate protection solution

### 3. **Key Features to Include**

#### **Interactive Elements**
- Role selector buttons at the top
- Smooth transitions between views
- Charts that initialize properly without infinite scrolling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

#### **Contrast ADR Focus**
- Emphasize ADR as immediate protection strategy
- Show current rule status (monitoring vs. blocking)
- 5-minute activation timeline
- Business continuity benefits
- Cost comparison: ADR protection vs. emergency shutdown vs. doing nothing

#### **Visual Design**
- Modern gradient backgrounds and card layouts
- Color-coded severity indicators (Critical=red, High=orange, Medium=yellow, etc.)
- Professional styling with hover effects
- Chart containers with fixed dimensions to prevent scrolling issues

### 4. **Technical Implementation Details**

#### **Chart.js Configuration**
```javascript
- Use initialization flags to prevent multiple chart creation
- Add setTimeout delays for DOM readiness
- Set fixed container heights and max-widths
- Include maintainAspectRatio: false for proper sizing
